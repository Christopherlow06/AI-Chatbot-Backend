Variant_1,Where to set the task cycle time of the TaskHighPrio,C:\Users\sgdrig01\Downloads\page 12.png,"The text ""Setting up"" does not appear in this image. Therefore, I cannot provide a field for that text. The closest relevant field is likely the one titled ""Setting"". This field asks about setting task cycle times and appears to be related to controlling tasks on a system or schedule.

Final Answer: Setting",99.89087104797363,"The text ""Setting up"" does not appear in this image. Therefore, I cannot provide a field for that phrase.

Variant_1,Does UHX65A-R01 support FSoE?,C:\Users\sgdrig01\Downloads\page 6.png,"The image shows a table with various columns, including ""Performance Class"" and ""Type"". The rows in the table are labeled with different types of controllers, such as UHX15A, UHX25A, UHX45A, UHX65A, and UHX86A.

To determine if UHX65A-R01 supports FSoE (Fast Serial Over Ethernet), we need to look at the ""FSoE"" column in the table. Unfortunately, the text in this column is not clearly visible.
