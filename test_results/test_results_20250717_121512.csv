1. **Using a MOVIGEAR DSI or MOVITRAC advanced inverter**: When utilizing a MOVIGEAR DSI or MOVITRAC advanced inverter, the task cycle time can be set using a minimum cycle time of 2 milliseconds. This is the default setting for these devices.

2. **When using a MOVISUITE from MOVISUITE 2.10**: In the case of MOVISUITE from MOVISUITE 2.10, the task cycle time of the TaskHighPrio can be set via MOVISUITE.
