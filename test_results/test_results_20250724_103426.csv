**Step 2: Attach the Splined Shaft**

*  Attach the splined shaft to the gearbox using the gearbox mounting kit screws.
*  Align the splines of the splined shaft and gearbox: Ensure that the splines on the splined shaft and gearbox align properly.

**Step 3: Tighten the Screws**

*  Tighten the screws to the required torque: Tighten the screws in a star-shaped pattern to the specified torque value using a torque wrench.

**Step 4: Final Check**

*  Perform a final check: After tightening the screws, check the gear set to ensure it is properly assembled and functioning as expected.

**Step 5: Complete Assembly**

*  Assemble the drive system: Assemble the entire drive system according to the manufacturer's instructions, taking care not to exceed the maximum load capacity of the gear set.

Remember to consult the user manual for specific instructions and guidelines for your particular gear set, as these may vary slightly based on the manufacturer and model.",183.41073417663574,"To mount a shaft-mounted gear unit with a splined hollow shaft, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Preparation**

*  Prepare the equipment: a workstand or support with a rotating drive and a safety system (e.g., magnetic brakes).
*  Ensure the motor and drive components are correctly installed and operational.

**Step 2: Installation**

*  Install the shaft-mounted gear unit, aligning the splined hollow shaft of the motor with the splined output shaft of the gear unit.
*  Align the drive components, including the sprocket (if equipped) and pulley or toothed wheels.
*  Install mounting devices (e.g., clamps or bolts) to the mounting frame according to the installation manual or manufacturer's specifications.

**Step 3: Shaft Alignment and Torque**

*  Align the hollow shaft and input drive of the shaft-mounted gear unit.
*  Tighten mounting devices while verifying the tightness of the connections.
